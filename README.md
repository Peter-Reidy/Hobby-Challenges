# Hobby-Challenges
My solutions to common programming challenges

runFizzBang is my solution to the FizzBuzz challenge. This solution is a little funky because I forgot all about the modulus operator. This increased the challenge, and the fun.

StringEdit is my solution for removing selected letters from a given text.

StringPal is my solution to check if a word is a Palindrome. I chose not to use a Reverse() method.
